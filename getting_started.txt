You need to install R, RStudio, RTools, and then the packages used by the code, including rstan. See here for instructions:
https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started

If you want to clone the project and use version control (git, github) you will need to set it up as explained here:
https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200532077-Version-Control-with-Git-and-SVN
I recommend using an ssh key for authentication. Or you can just download the project files to your computer.

Once you have cloned and/or downloaded the repository from Github you should be able to open the RStudio project (bach_constant.Rproj) in RStudio. You should then be able to open the bach_driver.r file which is the main file. Sourcing this script should run the “run – eckhardt_priors_narrow” scenario without you needing to do anything else. It is set up to run quickly, so some of the sites will give non-convergance warnings.

Most scenario outputs will be produced, but there is currently an issue preventing the boxplots from being generated.

To set up your own runs and scenarios you need to provide:
(1) a scenario folder
(2) a line in bachrunlist.dat for each run
(3) data.dat files in the data folder (you can use the same data file for multiple runs)
(4) options.dat files in the data folder (you can use the same options file for multiple runs) 
(5) you will need to write your own read_data.r script.
(6) you will need to set from_scratch <- TRUE the first time to create the output files.
(7) you will need to write your own box_plots.r and trace_plots.r scripts.
